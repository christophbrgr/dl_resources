# Machine Learning in Medical Imaging
Resources for learning Deep and Machine Learning - esp. in the context of AI in medical applications

+++ Consider going carbon neutral with your DL efforts - don't underestimate the impact of intense network training on our climate. This is one great example https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/carbon-neutral-lab/.
